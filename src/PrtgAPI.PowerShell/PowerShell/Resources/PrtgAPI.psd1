PrtgAPI is a C#/PowerShell library that abstracts away the complexity of interfacing with the PRTG Network Monitor HTTP API.

PrtgAPI implements comprehensive type system providing an extensive array of functionality, enabling you to develop powerful applications for managing your network.

All cmdlets in PrtgAPI support some level of piping, allowing you to directly chain multiple cmdlets together to develop powerful one liners.

Operations supported by PrtgAPI include enumerating channels, sensors, devices, groups and probes, modifying object properties, creating brand new sensors, devices, groups and notification triggers, pausing, unpausing and acknowledging objects, renaming and removing items, and more.

PrtgAPI includes full Cmdlet Comment/XmlDoc documentation. Detailed information on any cmdlet can be found within PowerShell by running Get-Help <cmdlet> or Get-Help <cmdlet> -Full

For examples and usage scenarios, please see the Project Site.'
